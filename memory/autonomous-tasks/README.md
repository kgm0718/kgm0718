# Goal-Driven Autonomous Tasks

## Overview
Brain dump your goals and let the AI agent autonomously generate, schedule, and complete daily tasks — including building surprise mini-apps overnight!

## How It Works

### 1. Brain Dump Your Goals 🎯
Just tell the agent your high-level goals. Examples:
- "I want to learn Python"
- "Build a habit tracker app"
- "Organize my photos"
- "Create a personal finance dashboard"

### 2. AI Generates Tasks 🤖
The agent breaks down your goals into:
- **Daily tasks** - Small actionable steps
- **Research tasks** - Information gathering
- **Build tasks** - Mini-apps or scripts
- **Learning tasks** - Tutorials and practice

### 3. Autonomous Execution 🌙
- **Daytime**: Research, planning, small tasks
- **Overnight**: Build mini-apps, process data, generate reports

### 4. Morning Updates ☀️
Every morning, get a summary of:
- What was completed overnight
- Today's scheduled tasks
- Progress toward your goals
